                <p>Machine learning is right now one of the hottest field in the tech industry. And with the dawn of the A.I age,
                        it is more important than ever. So, what machine learning actually is?-one of the earliest 
                        definition as given by Arthur Samuel was “the field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without 
                        being explicitly programmed “which still remains quite relevant</p>

                <p>Before jumping right into the crux and components of machine learning, I would like to take you through its history and origin.
                     It is believed that it originated back in 1959, when a computer programmer wrote a program to play chess. He himself wasn’t a 
                     very good chess player yet in the beginning he was able to defeat the computer as it would mostly play the same type of moves. 
                     But with more and more matches the computer started registering the good and bad box position and after millions of matches 
                     it became so efficient that it was able to beat the programmer.</p>
